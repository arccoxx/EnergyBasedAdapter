# EnergyBasedAdapter
Inspired by EBM ideas, specifically Energy Based Transformers, energy based adapter uses an energy function to fit a LORA adapter.

Project status: Under Development
  -Repetitous generations
  -Unsure how many base optimization steps to use (linear entropy per opt_steps decrease suggests an infintie number of steps...)
